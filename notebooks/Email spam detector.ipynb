escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber defensive end bruce smith who was knocked out of sunday's game against the giants with a dislocated right shoulder will miss two to three weeks while the tissue

orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of sunday's game against green bay he

said that barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next sunday in st louis however it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over ron dayne so be careful starting

against washington according to the dallas morning news he has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of sunday's game carter isn't a recommended fantasy starter even when healthy matt hasselbeck qb sea texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hasselbeck groin missed seattle's win over jacksonville and watched trent dilfer lead the team

niners sunday he completed only escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a fantasy reserve at best wesley walls te car team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber walls proved to be quarterback chris weinke's best target sunday against the escapenumberers catching escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and a score walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from weinke when

aaron brooks qb no grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance sunday he only threw for escapenumber yards with an interception and no touchdown passes brooks has struggled in the last two games but the saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games michael vick qb atl really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber vick was an adequate replacement for the injured chris chandler but he failed to lead the falcons to the end zone he completed escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and also gained escapenumber yards on four carries look for vick to return to the bench next week patrick jeffers wr car c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jeffers knees missed sunday's game against san francisco he continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries but isn't ready to return to action just

camp it happened what two months ago and it probably won't heal until the offseason i just have to work through it barlow told the san francisco chronicle people don't know how bad this is hurting barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full time running back keep him on your bench for now shawn jefferson wr atl free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jefferson missed most of the second half of sunday's game due to neck and back injuries he will be evaluated on a daily basis receivers terance mathis brian finneran and

laveranues coles wr nyj team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber coles caught five passes for escapenumber yards and carried the ball two times for escapenumber yards at buffalo coles has apparently become an important part of the new york offense in his second pro season anthony becht te nyj free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber becht caught three passes for escapenumber yards and a td at buffalo despite some early struggles becht still appears to be an key member of the new york passing game on third downs and near the goal line peerless price wr buf drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber price caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the jets don't expect big numbers from price again in the near future he very rarely breaks loose for a big play the escapenumber yard td pass he caught in week four is not one of his usual feats travis henry rb buf c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber henry rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against the jets against low quality defenses that appear on the schedule henry should continue to be a good fantasy option keenan mccardell wr jac uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mccardell caught seven passes for escapenumber yards at seattle the veteran wideout looks to be in good health again and should be a solid fantasy starter for the rest of the year itula mili te sea free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mili caught two passes for escapenumber yards and a td against jacksonville mili is quick and has good hands he is worth a look if you need help at the tight end position shaun alexander rb sea houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alexander rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and scored two tds against jacksonville he will continue to be a good fantasy starter while ricky watters is out and alexander seems to be more of a td threat than watters can be right now stacey mack rb jac drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mack was benched at seattle on sunday in the second quarter after rushing for only escapenumber yards on eight carries on his final attempt of the day he lost a fumble and was replaced by rookie elvis joseph the first year back rushed for only escapenumber yards and fumbled as well but he caught an escapenumber yard td pass now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game at rb for the jaguars if fred taylor is not ready to return from a groin injury after the bye week tyrone wheatley rb oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wheatley scored two tds against dallas on sunday his rushing totals escapenumber yards were modest however and it's still tough to start him on a weekly basis due to the presence of charlie garner tim brown wr oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught seven passes for escapenumber yards in oakland's win over dallas he continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a fantasy perspective joey galloway wr dal team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dallas tried to open up their offense against oakland and galloway's numbers improved slightly as a result he had his best game of the season posting escapenumber yards receiving and a td those are modest numbers however so don't think of starting him on a weekly basis aaron stecker rb tb president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against green bay he does not appear to be a viable option for the buccaneers while warrick dunn is out tampa bay apparently still has faith in mike alstott emmitt smith rb dal team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith was held in check once again posting only escapenumber yards of total offense against oakland without an effective passing game smith is going to have a long season anthony wright qb dal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wright took over at qb for dallas after quincy carter left in the first quarter with a strained hamstring he completed escapenumber of escapenumber for escapenumber yards and two tds against oakland but still has very little value as a fantasy player mike alstott rb tb luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alstott rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and a td against the packers the big fullback proved he can still be a dependable fantasy rb frank wycheck te ten drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wycheck left sunday's game against baltimore with a neck strain he did not return to the game and will be re evaluated on monday antonio freeman wr gb drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber freeman caught only one pass for six yards

escapenumber escapenumber gary carried the ball only nine times for escapenumber yards in denver's escapenumber escapenumber win over kansas city he may have slipped to no escapenumber on the depth chart behind mike anderson mike anderson rb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber anderson posted escapenumber yards rushing and a score against kansas city on sunday he received much more of the workload in the denver backfield than olandis gary and may be emerging as the team's no escapenumber back bill schroeder wr gb grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber schroeder caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td at tampa bay the green bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense proving he has indeed become a quality fantasy player rod smith wr den blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith had another huge outing posting eight receptions for escapenumber yards and a score against kansas city smith is establishing himself as one of the best wideouts in the league this season and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis brian griese qb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber griese struggled for the second consecutive week posting only escapenumber yards passing and a td against kansas city griese's numbers are being hurt somewhat by the loss of ed mccaffrey but he still warrants a weekly starting spot in most leagues fantasy wise priest holmes rb kc houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber holmes put up decent numbers against denver posting seven receptions and escapenumber yards of total offense he's not worthy of a starting spot every week but he could be useful when the matchup is right trent

defense and was held without a td pass in the chiefs' escapenumber escapenumber loss keyshawn johnson wr tb orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson left sunday's game vs

updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jenkins caught six passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the eagles don't expect such totals from jenkins on a regular basis he might draw more defensive attention in the coming weeks and has never proved he can put up good numbers in the past todd pinkston wr phi drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pinkston caught four passes for escapenumber yards and two tds against the cardinals the young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality fantasy player because of his good hands concentration and leaping ability correll buckhalter rb phi uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber buckhalter rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against arizona the rookie has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the injured duce staley jake plummer qb ari really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber plummer threw for escapenumber yards two tds and an interception in a win over philadelphia his respectable performance against the eagles' strong defense should convince many fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a backup jay fiedler qb mia c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber fiedler threw for only escapenumber yards and a td and was intercepted once by the patriots don't depend on fiedler for quality fantasy numbers on a weekly basis james mcknight wr mia free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mcknight caught two passes for just escapenumber yards against the patriots the veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable fantasy production troy brown wr ne houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught five passes for escapenumber yards at

the rookie posted five receptions for escapenumber yards in the game antowain smith rb ne team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith rushed for escapenumber yards and a td at miami

midway through the first half quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter left sunday's game against oakland in the first quarter due to a strained left hamstring he did not return to the game and will be re evaluared on monday anthony wright replaced the rookie qb in the lineup for dallas travis taylor wr bal drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber taylor had his second consecutive good outing on sunday posting five receptions and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory over tennessee if he continues to produce taylor may warrant a starting role from a fantasy perspective on a more regular basis peter warrick wr cin dont mess updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber warrick caught four passes for just escapenumber yards against the steelers jon kitna has been working more exclusively with darnay scott and warrick hasn't put up good fantasy numbers yet this season jason brookins rb bal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brookins saw an increase in his carries on sunday against tennessee and his numbers really reflected it he posted escapenumber yards and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory and could see more playing time in the ravens' offense from now on hines ward wr pit team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ward caught eight passes escapenumber yards against the bengals he continues to be pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver and now qualifies as a solid fantasy reserve terry allen rb bal texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber allen finally had a productive game posting escapenumber yards rushing and a touchdown against tennessee however he still isn't a player that fantasy owners should depend on for consistent production erron kinney te ten free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber kinney had a solid game against baltimore posting seven catches for escapenumber yards he is putting a dent into frank wycheck's numbers early in the year and will likely play a more prominent role in the titans' offense this season jerome bettis rb pit blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bettis rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against cincinnati he will continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective but the pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities ricky williams rb no uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber despite a slight shoulder injury

trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .\nthe total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .\non the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .\nin yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .\nthe filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .\nthe sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .\nthe sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit -

end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , \" yesterday ' s sec filing said .\nan andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement \" an unfortunate situation \" but said the accounting firm is \" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . \" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .\namong the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael\nkopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .\nas reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .\nin 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .\nby having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .\nmr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .\nenron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .\nljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .\nseveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said \" it is possible \" that continuing enron reviews will \" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . \"\nas such , \" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , \" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis .\nthe enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships .\n- - - mea culpa\nin the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details\naccounting and other actions .\n- -

' '\nkenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .\nwhen electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .\ndynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .\nmr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player .

' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '\nit was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .\nmr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '\nenron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .\nthe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .\nthe remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .\n' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '\nwhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .\nmr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .\nenron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .\nin a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .\nbut enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .\nenron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .\nsome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .\nyesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .\nenron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .\nphoto : dynegy ' s chief executive , charles l . watson , is respected among stock analysts .

grade credit .\n( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )\nfor canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , \" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . \" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .\nthe futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .\nby putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .\nby some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .\nthat still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s \" counterparties \" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .\nwhat has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .\nwhy should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .\nthere were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .\ndonald coxe is chairman of harris investment management in chicago and toronto -

term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .\nbut those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron -

optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .\nalthough many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets , the deals are almost always with third parties and private investors rather than company executives . the involvement of executives as investors in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest , said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .\nthe securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships , which were approved by enron lawyers and directors .\nin essence , the partnerships reduced borrowings enron listed on its balance sheet . they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings .\nhowever , after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures , enron said in an sec filing thursday that it should have included the financial performance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet .\nthe filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents \" should not be relied upon . \"\nenron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 .\nthe enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction .\ndynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said .\nenron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said .\ndynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said .\nthere is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said .\ndynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities .\ndynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said .\nalthough enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days .\ngraphic : enron rescuer ? , los angeles times ;\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nsmall -

trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .\nand while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew .\ninvestors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .\nhowever , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace .\nenron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .\nthen , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity .\nseveral news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart .\nbesides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .\non thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details .\nthe new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported .\nenron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported .\nenron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could \" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . \"\n\" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , \" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive\nthe company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec .\njeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .\nwall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility .\nstill , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to \" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . \"\nchristopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting \" shenanigans \" are legendary in the industry .\n\" i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , \" ellinghaus said . \" enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . \"\nenron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .\nenron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .\n- -

paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks .\nnow , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .\nabout the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description .\nthere ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks .\nin these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future .\nhere is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : \" you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . \"\nso along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : \" some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . \" you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price .\nas for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger .\nfaced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .\nsuch transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .\ndisclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .\nopaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .\nbut investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\ncity -

that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .\nkatayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies .\nvelshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us .\ncopyright ?
